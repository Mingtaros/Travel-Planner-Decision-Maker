# Singapore Travel Itinerary Project

A personalized AI-powered travel planner for Singapore using Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) with a position-based Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) formulation.

## Overview

The Singapore Travel Itinerary Optimizer is a hybrid AI system that intelligently generates optimized, multi-day travel plans. It combines:
	â€¢	Multi-Agent RAG for intelligent POI retrieval and user query understanding
	â€¢	ALNS with position-based VRP formulation for optimizing itineraries based on budget, time, and satisfaction constraints

This end-to-end pipeline transforms a userâ€™s travel query into a cost-effective and satisfying itinerary using LLM agents, search, and combinatorial optimization.

## Key Features

### Optimization Capabilities
- ðŸ¤– Multi-Agent RAG System:
    - Supervisor Agent: Understands whether the user wants food or attractions
    - Attraction & Hawker Agents: Retrieve relevant POIs from PgVector DB
    - Itinerary Planner Agent: Generates travel plans with cost, time, and satisfaction estimates
- Multi-objective optimization (cost, travel time, satisfaction) & Multi-Day Travel Itineraries
- Position-based VRP solution representation
- Time window enforcement for meal constraints
- Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search with specialized operators
- Automatic meal scheduling (lunch and dinner at hawker centers)

### Constraints Handling
- Time window management with explicit timing
- Budget constraints with fine-grained control
- Meal requirements (lunch and dinner at hawker centers)
- Transportation mode selection (transit or drive)
- Attraction uniqueness (each attraction visited at most once)
- Daily attraction limits for realistic itineraries

### Export Capabilities
- Detailed JSON itineraries with timing information
- Transportation details between locations
- Cost breakdown by category
- Satisfaction and time metrics

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Google Maps API Key
- OpenAI API Key
- Groq API Key
- Required Python packages (install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

## Tech Stack for Mutli Agent RAG
- Agno Framework for LLM-based agent orchestration

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Google Maps,OpenAI, and Groq API key:
   ```
   GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
   See `.env.example` file for the template.
3. Install required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Turn on Docker service and run the Posgres VectorDB (PGVector):
    ```bash
    docker run -d \
        -e POSTGRES_DB=ai \
        -e POSTGRES_USER=ai \
        -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=ai \
        -e PGDATA=/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata \
        -v pgvolume:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
        -p 5532:5432 \
        --name pgvector \
        agnohq/pgvector:16
    ```

## Data Preparation

The itinerary optimization requires two preprocessing steps:

### Step 1: Generate Waypoints

Run the following command to geocode all locations and store them in JSON format:

```bash
python ./src/route_matrix/waypoint_generator.py --attractions data/locationData/attractions.csv --hawkers data/locationData/hawkers.csv --output data/waypointData/waypoints.json
```

This script:
- Reads attractions and hawker centers from CSV files
- Geocodes them using the Google Maps API
- Stores the coordinates in a JSON file (`data/waypointData/waypoints.json`)
- Only needs to be run once (unless new locations are added)

### Step 2: Generate Route Matrix

Run the following command to generate route matrices for different times of day:

**NOTE: PLEASE CHECK API USAGE LIMITS FOR FREE TIER AND ADJUST NUMBER OF LOCATIONS USED ACCORDINGLY**

```bash
python ./src/route_matrix/generate_route_matrix.py --waypoints data/waypointData/waypoints.json --output-dir data/routeData
```

This script:
- Loads waypoints from the JSON file
- Processes them in batches to comply with Google Maps API limits (100 elements per request)
- Computes transit and driving routes between all locations for different times of day
- Calculates fares for each route type
- Saves the results in JSON files (`data/routeData/route_matrix_*.json`)

## Streamlit Application

### Basic Usage
```bash
streamlit run ./src/alns_itinerary/streamlit_app.py
```

Enter the itinerary details and click on Generate Itinerary

## Evaluation

### Basic Usage
Update the dictionary `user_queries` and update line 115 with the query key.
```bash
python ./src/alns_itinerary/evalute_alns_agentic_rag.py
```

### `config.json`

### Examining Results

After ALNS optimization completes, you can find the itineraries in the `results` directory:
- `initial_itinerary_TIMESTAMP.json`: The initial solution before optimization
- `best_itinerary_TIMESTAMP.json`: The optimized itinerary

## Algorithm Overview

### Position-Based VRP Representation
- Each solution is represented as a sequence of locations with arrival and departure times
- Natural handling of time windows and sequence constraints
- Direct enforcement of meal timing requirements

### Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS)
- **Destroy Operators**:
  - `destroy_targeted_subsequence`: Removes a subsequence of attractions while preserving meals
  - `destroy_worst_attractions`: Removes attractions with poor satisfaction-to-cost ratio
  - `destroy_distant_locations`: Removes locations requiring excessive travel
  - `destroy_expensive_attractions`: Removes costly attractions to improve budget utilization
  - `destroy_selected_day`: Restructures an entire day while preserving meals

- **Repair Operators**:
  - `repair_regret_insertion`: Uses regret-based insertion with meal scheduling
  - `repair_transit_efficient_insertion`: Prioritizes travel time efficiency
  - `repair_satisfaction_driven_insertion`: Prioritizes overall satisfaction

- **Simulated Annealing**: Temperature-based acceptance of worse solutions to explore solution space

## Notes and Assumptions
- Routes data is obtained through Google Maps API
- Assume that Hotel Prices and Entrance fee prices are static
- Performance depends on the size of the problem instance
- Quality of results depends on the accuracy of location data
